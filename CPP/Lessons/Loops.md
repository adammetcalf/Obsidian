There exist 3 Loop Types: For Loop, While Loop and DoWhile Loop.

# **For Loop**

A for loop iterates for exactly as many times as you tell it.

Syntax:

```
for (initialisation; condition; increment/decrement){

	//code to execute
	
}
```

Example:

```
for (int i =0; i<5; i++){

	//Do a thing

}
```


# **While Loop**

A while loop runs as long as a specified condition is true.

syntax:
```
while (condition){

	//code to exectute

}
```

Example:
```
int i =0;
while (i<5) {

	i++;

}
```

# **DoWhile**

A DoWhile runs at least once, since the condition is not checked until the end of the loop.

syntax:
```
do {

	//code to execute
	
} while (condition)
```


Example: 

```
i = 0;
do {

	i++
	
} while (i<5)
```
