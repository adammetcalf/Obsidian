FBG:
E = 7GPa glass (from FBGS Website)
E = 2GPa (ORMOCER Coating). From [FBGS Website](https://fbgs.com/faq/what-is-the-youngs-modulus-of-the-dtg-sensor/).

EcoFlex 0030:
E circa 100MPa



# Composite Properties

Note that I (second moment of area) is not the same as I (inertia). Henceforth in this document I refers to the second moment of area.

For a solid circle:

$I = \frac{\pi d^4 }{64}$ â€‹

For an annulus:

$I = \frac{\pi (d^4_{outer} - d^4_{inner}) }{64}$ 


The Cross Section of the tentacle is given:

Outer: Circa 100MPa, mid circa 2GPa, inner circa 70GPa

Outer: 3mm diameter, Mid, 0.2mm diameter, Inner, 0.13mm diameter
