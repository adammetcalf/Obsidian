Stogl Robotics has released a package which communicates with Kuka over the [RSI interface](https://www.kuka.com/en-gb/products/robotics-systems/software/application-software/kuka_robotsensorinterface) and it looks like another expensive addon. Also, it apparently works on only Kuka System Software (KSS) 8.3 - 8.7

I have not seen RoboticSensorInterface as one of the installable packages in Sunrise Workbench.
